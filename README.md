# Basic React app
this is just a basic React app made following Brad Traversy's React front-to-back Udemy course.  Just a simple warmup, practicing basic React hooks, state management, and component building.  
Note:  This particular Udemy course is a couple years behind, and so I needed to make appropriate changes myself.  For example:  switching from create-react-app (now deprecated) to Vite, and upgrading from React Route v5 -> v6 and 7.
